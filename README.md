# PredictaBall

### Aim of the Project: 
To predict the outcome of the Football Matches in the Premiere League and create a profitable betting algorithim

## Intoduction
The first aim was to merge data from different sources into one data frame.
The base data frame was made from CSVs downloaded from [football-data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) which provided a data point for each match with the Home and Away teams and the result, along with other match data such as the score and the bookie's odds of each outcome.
The next stage was to find more predictors to add to the data frame; ELO ranking from [Club Elo](http://clubelo.com/) and the [League Table data](https://www.twtd.co.uk/league-tables/competition:premier-league/daterange/) were thought to be the best.
